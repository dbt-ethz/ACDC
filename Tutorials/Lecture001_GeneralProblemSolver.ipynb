To achieve a\n","goal state, GPS uses means-ends analysis: each operator is examined to find one\n","that contains the goal state in its add-list (it looks for an *appropriate*\n","operator).  It then tries to achieve all of that operator's precondition states.\n","If not all of the preconditions can be achieved (the operator is not\n","*applicable*), then GPS looks for another appropriate operator.  If none exists,\n","then the goal can't be achieved.
